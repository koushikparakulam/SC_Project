This project folder contains the completed code and results for the **Understanding Developing Neuronal Subtypes within the Superior Colliculus** project. 
There are three folders and one pdf contained within this folder as follows:

  - Neuronal Subtypes in the SC using scRNA-Seq (START HERE FOR PROJECT INFORMATION)
  - All_Programs 
  - Permanent Results
  - Testing Results

Neuronal Subtypes in the SC using scRNA-Seq, contains slides associated with the project for any introductory information on how the data was collected, analysis was performed, etc. 

All Programs contains all the code associated with the collected results. For an overview of the bulk of the project code and running purposes, check out the **MAIN_Load_Output.ipynb file**.

Permanent Results contains the final collected results of the project, some data of which were hand curated based on specificity. To explore the detailed results of the project refer to these
results. 

Testing Results contains any temporary data from reruns of the main program. This allows for any changes wanted to be made and tried out to be reapplied to see the ways in which it affects
the outputted data.
